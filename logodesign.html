     <p class="p-text"> As the designer of Archtag, an app startup company, I designed the logo for the app called Umi.  The logo has to be memorable and also need to give the feeling of technology and the concept of fun.  The name of the application means “international students’ rice” in Chinese, which indicated the app was as essential as the rice to the international student.  Based on the meaning of the application, I started using pencil to sketch my ideas.
